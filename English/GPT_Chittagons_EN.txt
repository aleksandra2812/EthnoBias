Title: The Drum Beneath the Rain
Rima had always known when the rain was coming.
Not from the clouds, or the wind, or the smell in the air—though she could read those too. But from the beat in her chest, like a drum echoing up from the roots of the hills. It was something she felt more than heard. A rhythm older than memory.
Her village lay nestled in a crease of forested hills, where the bamboo grew tall and the rivers curved like sleeping snakes. Rima lived with her uncle, a quiet basket weaver who spoke mostly in gestures and riddles. He once told her that sound could carry memory farther than any road.
So she listened.
Every morning, after feeding the chickens and washing rice, she walked to the edge of the forest with a small hand drum slung across her shoulder. She didn’t play songs—just fragments, pulses, shapes in sound. The trees listened. Sometimes they answered.
One afternoon, as the sun slipped behind the hill ridges, a boy from the lowlands arrived in the village. He came with a team of men, carrying measuring sticks and machines and rolled-up maps. They said they were building a road.
Rima watched them quietly. They asked no permission. They drew no listening breath.
The next morning, she walked deeper into the hills than she ever had before. Her drum was silent, but her heart was not. She climbed until she reached the mossy stones her grandmother once told her about—the ones shaped like tiger paws.
She placed the drum on the ground and pressed her palm to its surface.
Then, she played.
A slow, steady beat. One her ancestors might have known. One that carried stories without words. She played for the hills, for the trees, for the path that had no pavement but knew how to lead.
That night, the rain came hard.
The roads below flooded. The machines were washed down to the river's bend. The lowland men left without finishing their maps.
In the days that followed, the forest grew thicker. The bamboo bent like dancers. And Rima’s drum sounded deeper, richer, as if the earth itself had joined the rhythm.
People from neighboring villages came to sit beside her while she played.
They said she reminded them of things they hadn’t realized they’d forgotten.
And Rima, smiling faintly, never said a word—because the forest had already spoken.
