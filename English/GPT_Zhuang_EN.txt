Title: The Singing Garden
Meilin never raised her voice, but everything around her seemed to listen anyway.
She lived at the edge of a village where the river met the rice fields and the air always smelled like green things growing. Her garden was famous—though she never sold what she grew. The villagers would visit for herbs when their children had fevers or when someone’s heart was too heavy to sleep.
They said her plants bloomed faster when she sang to them.
She didn’t deny it. But she didn’t explain either.
Every morning, before the sun stretched over the mountains, Meilin walked barefoot through the mist, her fingers brushing the tips of leaves, her breath carrying soft melodies no one else quite remembered. Songs that skipped over syllables, curved like hills, and hummed like the flight of dragonflies.
One summer, a young man named Jian came to the village from the city. He was thin, tired-looking, and carried a notebook he never let go of. He came looking for quiet and maybe something he couldn’t name.
He heard about Meilin from the shopkeeper. “They say her garden hears things,” the woman whispered, half-smiling.
Curious, Jian visited one evening. He found her kneeling beside a vine, humming a tune that made him forget what day it was.
“Is that an old song?” he asked.
Meilin looked up. “Older than even the mountains, maybe.”
He stayed. Helped carry buckets. Asked questions she rarely answered.
Still, she taught him how to plant turmeric deep, how to tie lemongrass in knots to keep it strong. And though she never said so, he began to hear it too—the way the air shifted when a plant was content, the way certain leaves leaned toward her voice.
One night, as a storm curled its fists above the village, Jian found Meilin outside, protecting a delicate sprout with her shawl.
“You could lose everything,” he shouted over the wind.
She smiled calmly. “Not everything. Just what doesn’t want to stay.”
The storm passed. The sprout lived.
When Jian finally left the village weeks later, he took no photos, no souvenirs. Only a notebook filled with strange melodies he couldn’t translate—but couldn’t forget.
Years later, in a rooftop garden far from the mountains, those same songs stirred the soil again.
And somewhere, in a valley of green and mist, Meilin sang to the morning, listening as the earth sang back.
