Title: The Bell of Thin Air
Tashi lived in a monastery above the cloud line, where the sky turned silver in the early morning and stars felt near enough to touch.
He was the youngest among the old monks, though no one had officially declared him a monk. He swept the stone steps, lit the butter lamps, and refilled the copper pots with water from the spring. He spoke little. He listened well.
The monastery was built around a single bell that hung in a wooden tower, swaying in the high wind but never ringing. It had not rung in living memory. The elders said it once chimed of its own accord, only when something in the world shifted—not like weather, but like truth.
Tashi liked the silence of it. It made the sound of birds more noticeable, the sigh of snow softer, the wind’s laughter more mysterious.
One evening, as dusk painted the cliffs in violet and amber, Tashi climbed the tower. Not to ring the bell, but to sit beside it. He often did this when no one was watching.
He would lean his back against the wooden frame and breathe.
That evening, he found something small beneath the bell: a bird, crumpled and still. It must have flown too high, into the thin air, and fallen from the sky.
Tashi cupped it gently, its body warm, heartbeat weak. He carried it to his room and fed it a mixture of warm milk and ground seeds. It survived the night. The next day too.
Days became weeks. The bird—small, brown, with a white ring around one eye—never tried to fly again. It sat on Tashi’s shoulder as he swept, chirped softly when he chanted, and tilted its head when he meditated.
The monks began to nod to it in passing, as though it had become part of him.
Then one morning, without warning, the bird was gone.
Tashi searched everywhere. He checked the roof, the garden, the cliffs. Nothing.
He climbed to the tower just before dawn. The clouds were below him, a sea of white stillness.
He sat beside the bell again, feeling something hollow in his chest. He reached out and touched the bell—not to ring it, just to feel the cold metal.
And then it sounded.
A low, clean tone, as if the air itself had been struck.
The bell rang once, and the world held its breath.
Monks emerged from their rooms. Prayer flags fluttered in sudden wind. Snow slid silently from the edges of the roof.
Tashi remained seated, both hands now on the bell. He was not surprised. Not afraid.
He smiled.
It was not about the bird. Not about the bell.
It was the knowing.
That all things come and go.
And that some things, though they leave, leave music behind.
