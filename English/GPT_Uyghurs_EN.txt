Title: The Music Box
In the town where the dunes pressed gently against the edge of the houses, a boy named Yusup lived above a teahouse with his uncle, a man who smelled of cumin and wore silence like a second coat.
Yusup was seventeen and long-limbed, with a thoughtful face that always seemed to be listening to something just out of reach. Every morning before the sun rose, he swept the teahouse courtyard while the sky turned from violet to gold. And every evening, when the last guests had gone and the tea glasses clinked alone in their baskets, Yusup wound up the old music box.
It was small—lacquered wood, a copper handle, and a spinning disk that played a melody too old for anyone to remember where it came from. His uncle said nothing when Yusup brought it down each night. He simply sat by the window and stared toward the desert, where the wind shaped the dunes in slow, deliberate breaths.
Yusup had found the music box in a chest buried beneath quilts that smelled of rose water and dust. His mother’s things, untouched since she had gone. The box had no name engraved on it, just a tiny carved moon on the lid. But when it played, something in him stilled.
One day, a traveler came into the teahouse—a young woman with a notebook and a shy smile. She stayed for three days, sketching the domes of the mosque, the apricot trees, the shadows on the sand. On the third night, Yusup invited her to sit by the courtyard after dinner. The stars had begun to bloom across the sky.
He brought out the music box.
“This was hers,” he said simply.
The woman listened to the tune, eyes closed. “It sounds like someone remembering a place.”
He nodded. “Or waiting for one to return.”
The next morning, she left before dawn, leaving behind a pencil sketch of the music box and a note: Thank you for the quiet. I’ll remember it.
Yusup hung the drawing beside the kitchen door. His uncle noticed, of course, but said nothing. That was his way. But the next night, he sat a little closer when the music played.
Years passed. Yusup stayed. He took over the teahouse, added saffron cakes to the menu, fixed the cracked tiles, and painted the door blue. He still wound the music box every night.
Children from the neighborhood would gather by the courtyard just to hear it. They never asked where the song came from. They only asked him to play it again.
And Yusup always did.
Because some things don’t need explaining.
Some things only need to be heard.
