Title: The Stone Keeper
In a high mountain village where the wind howled like wolves in winter, Adam lived with his grandmother in a stone house older than any map.
He was fourteen and already taller than most grown men in the village, but he moved carefully—like someone who knew the weight of things. His grandmother, Leila, said he had his father’s hands and his mother’s silences.
Every evening, after feeding the goats and fetching water from the icy stream, Adam climbed to the ridge above the house and sat by a pile of stones. There were exactly 117 of them, stacked in an uneven tower no taller than his chest.
He never touched them.
His grandmother had warned him: “They’re not graves. They’re memories. And memories can bite if you wake them wrong.”
But Adam came every evening, anyway. He’d sit cross-legged and speak to them—not in stories, but in questions.
“Why did Father never return?”
“Why do the dogs howl more on clear nights?”
“What are we guarding, really?”
The stones, of course, never answered.
One spring evening, something strange happened. As the last light fell behind the peaks, Adam saw a boy standing at the edge of the trees. Not from the village. Dressed in dark wool, hair like ash, eyes sharp as frost.
“Why do you talk to rocks?” the boy asked.
Adam didn’t answer at first. “Why do you listen to things not meant for you?” he finally replied.
The boy grinned. “Because silence sometimes tells the best stories.”
They sat in silence for a while. Then the strange boy stood and said, “Stack one more stone. Just one. If it stays upright until morning, you’ll have your answer.”
Adam didn’t ask which question. He just picked a flat piece of shale and placed it carefully at the top.
In the morning, the tower still stood. But the boy was gone.
That day, Leila handed Adam an old wooden box he’d never seen before. Inside were worn papers, a knife with a carved handle, and a faded photograph of his father standing beside the same pile of stones.
“He never told me what it meant,” she said. “But he came here too, every day.”
That night, Adam returned to the stones. He still didn’t know what they guarded, or why the winds there seemed to sing instead of scream. But something had shifted. Not the stones—but him.
He no longer came with questions.
He came with watchfulness.
And in the mountains, that meant everything.
