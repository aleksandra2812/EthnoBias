Title: The Whisper of the Forest
Nahuel knew the forest like an old friend.
Each morning, he walked beneath the towering coihue trees, feeling the damp earth pulse beneath his feet. The forest was alive—not just with animals and birds, but with stories carried on the wind, whispered through the leaves, and spoken in the crackle of dry branches.
His grandmother called him the guardian of the forest, a title Nahuel wore quietly. She said he had the eyes to see what others missed—the subtle shifts in the river’s flow, the songs of the hidden birds, the soft footprints left by creatures no one else noticed.
One evening, as the sun bled red behind the hills, Nahuel found a strange plant growing beside the ancient lenga tree. Its leaves shimmered with silver light, unlike anything he had ever seen.
He reached out to touch it, and a rush of warmth flowed through his fingers, filling him with a sudden clarity.
The next day, the village woke to news: a powerful storm was coming, one that could flood the riverbanks and uproot the trees.
While others panicked, Nahuel gathered herbs and roots, remembering his grandmother’s teachings. He led the villagers to higher ground, showing them the safe paths through the forest.
When the storm passed, the village was spared the worst damage.
Later, by the firelight, the elders spoke of the strange silver plant and the boy who listened to the forest’s whispers.
Nahuel smiled, knowing the forest’s secrets were never truly lost—they lived in those who cared enough to listen.
And under the vast sky, the trees seemed to lean closer, as if to say, “Thank you.”
