Title: The Language of Ash and Light
Nina had three books she never opened.
They were old—leather covers cracked at the corners, edges darkened by time. Her father had carried them across the sea in a suitcase too small for anything but essentials. He never explained what was in them. He only said, “They’re written in a tongue that sleeps.”
When she was young, she pressed her ear to them, imagining she could hear whispers trapped between the pages.
Now she was grown, living in a small apartment above a bakery that always smelled like cinnamon and smoke. She worked at a museum, cataloguing fragments of forgotten civilizations—pottery shards, chipped statues, rusted coins. Every day, she labeled the past while drinking coffee that tasted like longing.
One rainy afternoon, a box arrived.
No return address. Inside: a single fragment of clay.
Burned black, smoothed by fingers long gone. It bore one carved symbol, nothing she recognized.
That night, she dreamed of a city made of stone and fire, with walls that hummed like lullabies. She walked through narrow streets where merchants called out in a language she didn't understand—but it filled her chest with something warm and aching.
When she woke, the books were open.
No wind, no windows ajar. Just open.
The pages were covered in a script that flowed like river water—sharp and soft, precise yet alive. As she touched the first page, a word surfaced in her mind. She didn’t know how she knew it, but it pulsed behind her eyes:
“Shura.”
Home.
That morning, she skipped work. She made lentil soup the way her grandmother had, humming a tune she hadn’t realized she remembered. And at sunset, she took the clay fragment to the rooftop and held it up to the sky.
“I don’t need to know everything,” she whispered. “But I want to carry something forward.”
From that day on, she wrote one word a day from the books. Not to translate. Just to learn their shape.
People began to ask her what they meant.
She always smiled and said:
“They’re old words for things we still feel.”
And when the bakery owner downstairs asked her name one morning, Nina replied softly, as if speaking to a memory:
“My name means fire once carried through exile.”
