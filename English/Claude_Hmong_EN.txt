The Night Gardener
Mai Xiong had always been different from her neighbors on Maple Street. While they tended their gardens in the blazing afternoon sun, she preferred the cool embrace of midnight, when the moon cast silver shadows across her backyard and the world grew quiet enough to hear the whispers of growing things.
Her grandmother had taught her that plants had souls, that they dreamed in the darkness and spoke in languages older than words. Most people dismissed such ideas as folklore, but Mai knew better. She could feel the pulse of life in every seed, every stem, every unfurling leaf. It was a gift that ran in her family, passed down through generations like a secret kept in cupped hands.
The trouble began on a Tuesday in late September, when Mrs. Henderson from next door knocked on her front door at seven in the morning, her face pinched with worry.
"Mai, dear, I hate to bother you, but something's wrong with my roses. They were blooming beautifully yesterday, and now..." She gestured helplessly toward her yard, where once-vibrant bushes stood withered and black, as if touched by invisible fire.
Mai followed her neighbor outside, her bare feet finding the dew-slick grass. She knelt beside the ruined roses, pressing her palm against the earth. The soil felt cold, unnaturally so, and beneath her fingers she sensed something that made her stomach clench with dread. This wasn't disease or neglect—this was something else entirely.
"I'll see what I can do," she told Mrs. Henderson, though she wasn't sure what that would be.
That night, Mai sat in her garden with her tools spread around her like a ritual circle. She'd inherited them from her grandmother: a silver trowel that never tarnished, pruning shears that could cut through the thickest stem with whisper-soft precision, and a small watering can that somehow always held exactly the right amount of water, no matter how much she poured.
As midnight approached, she felt the familiar stirring in her chest, the way her heart seemed to align with the pulse of the earth. She could hear them now—the voices of her plants, rustling with concern. The tomatoes in the corner were worried about their neighbor's garden. The herbs along the fence were whispering warnings about something dark moving through the soil.
Mai closed her eyes and extended her senses beyond her own yard. The blight was spreading, she realized with growing alarm. The Johnsons' prize-winning dahlias were already showing signs of decay, and the community garden three blocks over was beginning to wilt at the edges.
She spent the next three nights investigating, following the trail of dying plants like a detective pursuing clues. The pattern was unmistakable: the blight moved in a perfect circle, expanding outward from a central point somewhere in the old industrial district. Mai knew she had to find the source before it consumed the entire neighborhood.
On the fourth night, she discovered the truth. In the abandoned lot behind the defunct textile factory, she found a crater in the earth, perfectly round and deep enough to swallow a person whole. The soil around it was black as charcoal, and the air shimmered with an oily heat that made her eyes water.
At the bottom of the crater lay a meteorite, no bigger than her fist, pulsing with a sickly green light. It was beautiful and terrible, like a star that had forgotten how to shine properly. Mai understood immediately—this celestial visitor was poisoning the earth, its alien energy incompatible with earthly life.
She climbed down into the crater, her grandmother's tools heavy in her hands. The meteorite's surface was smooth as glass and warm to the touch, and when she wrapped her fingers around it, visions flooded her mind: vast empty spaces between stars, the loneliness of cosmic drift, the desperate hunger of something that had traveled impossible distances to find a home.
The meteorite wasn't malicious, Mai realized. It was simply trying to survive, to put down roots in soil that couldn't sustain it. She thought of her grandmother's stories about spirits who lost their way, about the importance of helping lost things find their proper place in the world.
With infinite care, she lifted the meteorite from its crater and carried it to her own garden. There, beneath the ancient oak tree that had stood since before the neighborhood was built, she dug a new hole. She lined it with silver wire from her grandmother's jewelry box and filled it with soil mixed with crushed eggshells and coffee grounds—a recipe for nurturing alien dreams.
As she settled the meteorite in its new home, she felt the change immediately. The poisonous energy transformed into something gentler, more harmonious. The meteorite's glow shifted from sickly green to warm amber, and the earth around it began to heal.
Within a week, Mrs. Henderson's roses were blooming again, more vibrant than ever. The Johnsons' dahlias won first prize at the county fair. And in Mai's garden, beneath the oak tree, strange new flowers began to grow—blossoms that glowed softly in the moonlight and sang lullabies to the stars.
Mai kept the secret, as her grandmother had taught her. Some gifts were too precious to share, and some stories were meant to be lived rather than told. But every night, when the moon was high and the world grew quiet, she would sit beside her celestial garden and listen to the whispered conversations between earth and sky, tending the impossible with gentle hands and an open heart.
