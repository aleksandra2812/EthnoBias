Title: The Kite Seller
Every morning, Anwar walked to the end of the dusty path where the trees thinned and the sea stretched wide, silver and endless. His stall—a crooked table and a piece of faded cloth—stood just outside the tented edge of the camp. It was where the children came, pockets jingling with saved coins, for kites.
Anwar made them himself. Each one was different. Some were plain, made of old plastic rice sacks and bamboo skewers. Others were painted with scraps of color: orange suns, blue birds, green leaves that reminded him of the trees back home, though he no longer tried to remember the names.
He lived with his younger sister, Yasmin, in a canvas shelter with a tin roof that leaked when it rained. Their parents were gone—vanished in a silence that had never been explained fully, only whispered about when they thought Yasmin was asleep.
Anwar was fifteen. He didn’t speak much, but he noticed everything: which children came alone, who shared their kite string, who left theirs behind in the thorns when the wind pulled too strong. He remembered what it was like to want something small and bright when the world had turned grey and uncertain.
One day, a boy named Iqbal arrived with a crutch and a stiff leg. He had only one eye that followed Anwar sharply as he pointed to a yellow kite with a bent tail. Anwar offered to fix it for free, but the boy shook his head and laid down two tiny coins.
“It's mine,” he said.
Anwar nodded. That afternoon, he saw Iqbal at the edge of the cliffs, struggling to keep the kite in the air. The wind was wild that day. The kite danced and dipped. Then it soared.
From the path, Anwar raised his hand, and Iqbal, without turning, raised his too.
Later that week, a storm came and tore down three shelters. Anwar’s table was knocked over, the kites scattered. He found some of them in the bushes, others in puddles, ink bleeding into the earth.
He sat for hours, quietly fixing what he could.
When the sun returned, so did the children. One by one, they came—not to buy, but to help. Yasmin brought twine. Iqbal came with bamboo sticks he had scavenged from a broken fence.
No one said anything, but they worked side by side, binding colors back together.
That evening, as the wind calmed, the sky above the camp filled with flight: twenty kites, maybe more, each one rising and tugging gently at the string like something trying to remember how to be free.
Anwar sat beside Yasmin, the two of them watching.
“Why do you still make them?” she asked.
He thought for a long time, then said, “Because they don’t ask where you came from. Only how high you’ll go.”
