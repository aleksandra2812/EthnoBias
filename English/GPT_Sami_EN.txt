Title: The Reindeer That Didn't Turn South
Elle stayed behind when the herd moved south.
Everyone else had followed the old route—grandparents on snowmobiles, younger cousins guiding the reindeer across frozen marshes and down into the forested valleys. The migration happened every year, same time, same direction. But Elle remained at the edge of the plateau, watching the animals go, wrapped in her father’s old wool coat.
“I’ll catch up,” she had said.
She didn’t.
There was one reindeer—white-faced, with a broken left antler—that hadn’t moved with the others. It lingered on the edge of the birch trees, nose to the wind, as if waiting for something. Elle watched it for three days before she followed it into the hills.
It never let her too close, but it didn’t run. It moved slowly, deliberately, always just within sight. Sometimes she lost it behind a snowdrift or a twist of pines, but it always appeared again, calm and ghostlike.
At night, she lit a small fire and sat beneath the northern lights. The sky rippled with green and violet as she whispered old songs her mother used to hum while mending gloves. The cold didn’t bother her much—not in that quiet place where time felt slow and everything breathed in rhythm.
On the fifth day, she found a frozen lake she didn’t recognize. The reindeer stood at its center, still and alert.
Elle stepped onto the ice, boots crunching softly.
She approached, and for the first time, it didn’t move.
There was something beneath the surface—something caught in the ice. A shape. A memory.
A sled.
Her grandfather’s sled, she realized. The one lost in a storm when she was six. Her family had searched for days, but snow had hidden everything.
Elle knelt. The reindeer stood beside her, breathing clouds into the cold air.
She laid her hand on the ice. Just for a moment. Then rose, turned, and began walking south.
She didn’t look back, but she knew the reindeer had vanished.
When she reached the herd days later, her boots soaked and her coat torn, no one asked where she’d gone. Her uncle only pressed a bowl of warm stew into her hands and said, “You came back with the wind.”
That spring, Elle took her grandfather’s old tools and began carving again—antler, wood, stone. She shaped the white-faced reindeer into every piece.
Not as a warning.
Not even as a legend.
Just as a way to remember:
That sometimes, it’s the one who doesn’t follow the path
who finds what the rest forgot.
