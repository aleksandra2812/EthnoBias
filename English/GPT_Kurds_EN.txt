Title: The Last Fig Tree
In a steep valley where mist clung to the morning like an old friend, a boy named Baran lived with his grandmother in a stone house perched above the village. He was twelve, wiry and quiet, with hair always a little tousled by the wind and eyes that followed the flight of birds more often than the movements of people.
Behind their home, a narrow path led up into the hills, where terraced plots once fed dozens of families. Most of the villagers had gone to the cities now, but Baran and his grandmother stayed. "The earth remembers us," she said when asked why.
Baran’s favorite place was a crumbling orchard on the upper slope. Wild grasses had overtaken the paths, and thorny bushes crawled over the fallen stones. Only one fig tree still stood—a twisted old thing with bark like folded parchment and a lean of stubborn defiance. Every summer it bore fruit, small and sweet, as if it had never noticed the passing of time or people.
Each morning before school, Baran brought a tin pail of water up to the tree. It wasn’t necessary—the tree had roots deep enough to survive without him—but he came anyway. He weeded around the base. He spoke to it sometimes. He told it how the teacher had praised his handwriting, how the butcher’s dog had finally stopped barking at him, how he’d seen a fox just before dawn.
In late summer, just before the harvest, the sky turned strange. The wind came from the east—hot and dust-thick. Baran watched the clouds roll like bruises across the sky. That night, lightning struck the ridge, and by morning, fire ran wild through the dry grass and pine.
The village emptied. Baran and his grandmother packed what they could. The goats had to be released, the chickens left to fate. As they descended toward the lower road, smoke curling in the sky behind them, Baran looked back once.
The fig tree stood at the edge of the fire line, its crown blackened by ash, but not yet burning.
They stayed in the next town for a week. The fire passed, but the damage was done. Baran’s grandmother said nothing for two days, then finally whispered, “We’ll go back. If the wind has mercy.”
When they returned, the orchard was mostly gone. Charcoal stumps dotted the hillside. The stones were hot to the touch. But the fig tree remained—half its branches singed and curling, but alive.
Baran knelt beside it, touched the bark gently, and whispered, “I knew you would wait.”
Every year after that, Baran returned. He grew older. He left for school in the city, came back during summers. The village never regained its old life, but Baran rebuilt the orchard, one sapling at a time.
And always, the old fig bore fruit—quiet, sweet, and faithful.
