Title: The Word Beneath the Mango Tree
Arun’s grandfather always said that some words weren’t meant to be written.
“They live in the roots,” he’d say, tapping his cane on the red earth. “In the wind. In your spine, when you speak from truth.”
Arun didn’t understand. He preferred words in books—tidy, printed, explainable. He spent most of his days under the old mango tree behind the house, nose buried in novels about cities he’d never seen and trains that ran on time.
But every Sunday, his grandfather made him help in the garden.
“Not for the vegetables,” he’d say, kneeling down slowly. “For the stories. The soil remembers more than the sky does.”
It wasn’t until his grandfather passed that Arun truly noticed how silent the garden had become.
No more singing to the basil. No more clapping twice before picking a lemon. No more whispered thanks to the ants.
The mango tree bore no fruit that year.
One evening, missing his grandfather too much to read, Arun sat beneath the tree and closed his eyes. The wind rustled the dry leaves like paper, and for a moment, he thought he heard a voice.
Not a sentence. Just a word.
It came again a week later, when he was watering the bitter gourd vines. A single syllable, soft and round, echoing inside his chest.
He didn’t understand the word—but it felt like it understood him.
From that day, Arun began to listen more. He stopped reading as much and started planting. He used the old clay pots, the broken tools his grandfather had tied with wire. He began humming when he worked—not songs from the radio, but melodies he didn’t know he knew.
And the mango tree began to bloom.
Tiny at first. Then wild and generous.
Neighbors came to sit beneath it again. His aunt brought tea. A boy from school started visiting with his sketchbook. Arun didn’t say much. But he began to write again—only now, in the margins of brown paper, with charcoal, sketching the shapes of those strange, rooted words he still couldn’t name.
One day, he found a seed beneath the mango tree. Unusual—flat, glowing faintly in the morning sun. He planted it without thinking.
The next season, something new grew. Not a mango tree. Not anything he'd ever seen. Small, silver-green leaves shaped like commas, curling and bright.
He didn’t ask what it was.
He only said:
“Welcome back.”
