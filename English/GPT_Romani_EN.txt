Title: The Violin Under the Willow
No one knew exactly when Mira’s family arrived in the village. They came in painted wagons, their wheels clicking like soft applause along the gravel road. By the time the sun rose the next morning, there was a firepit in the meadow, a red scarf tied to the old willow, and music drifting between the fields.
Mira was twelve and never without her violin.
She wore mismatched boots, danced while she tuned, and played with her eyes half-closed as if listening to something only she could hear. The villagers watched from a distance at first, curious, wary, enchanted.
One afternoon, during market day, Mira stood at the square’s edge and began to play. Her bow moved slowly, then faster, her foot tapping against the stones. The music she played wasn’t loud or showy. It was gentle. Curious. Like a question you ask without words.
A boy named Elias listened.
He’d never heard a song like that. It didn’t follow the rules of what he’d been taught in music class. It slipped and bent and returned again, like wind through tall grass.
He approached her the next day, offering a wooden flute he’d carved himself. “Maybe you can teach me?”
She grinned. “Maybe you can listen.”
For weeks, they met by the willow tree outside the village. She showed him rhythms, not notes. Patterns, not rules. “The melody isn’t what you play,” she told him, “it’s what you feel between the playing.”
Elias began to understand.
Summer passed. Her family stayed longer than usual, saying the earth felt good here, soft and old. They sold trinkets and repaired shoes and told stories that didn’t ask for truth to be real.
But when the leaves began to turn, Mira’s father started checking the wagons again. One morning, she told Elias, “We’re leaving soon.”
He didn’t know what to say. He just nodded, then handed her a folded sheet of paper—a tune he had written, one she’d helped him hear.
That night, from the edge of the woods, Mira played it back to the village.
People heard it from their windows. Soft. Low. Full of light.
And by morning, her wagon was gone.
Years later, when Elias became the village music teacher, he hung a red scarf near the schoolyard willow and taught his students the strange, winding tune he called The Song of Between.
And sometimes—when the wind was right—he thought he heard a violin answering, far off, beyond the trees.
